# Intro

I am a Physics student pursuing my Masters in Physics. I enjoy working on projects that fuse art and computer science with some Physics applications. For the past three years I'm learning theory deeply and practicing problems for a better understanding of the subject. Also I'm practicing to get comfortable with long & complex mathematical calculations to interpret its physical meaning. I'm interested in technology and how it has shaped the world and how it plays the great part advancing the present physics application. But it can't get better on its own so I want to be a part of the process which is doing so. I believe using technology and Physics, we can form a bridge so that one can appreciate the beauty of Physics.

# Currently

Currently I am completing my Masters in Physics from Hindu College, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India. I had successfully completed my Bachelors of Science (Honours) in Physics from Hindu College, University of Delhi as well. I am good in the numerical techniques especially in programming environments of C/C++, Fortran and software like Scilab and currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with softwares like Matlab. Also summer projects helped me understand the code regardless of the language.
